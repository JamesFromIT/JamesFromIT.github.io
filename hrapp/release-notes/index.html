You can now use F3 to switch to web referencing, F4 to switch to book referencing, F5 to clear the form and Escape to minimize the app.</p><h4>Made some changes to the 'About' form...</h4><p>The 'About' dialog has been set to a fixed dialog and the icon has been updated with a black version of the icon so that it stands out better.</p><h3>V1.1</h3><h4>Squashed some bugs!</h4><p>Copying the context of the label instead of the input field with Corporate Author in-line referencing...? That's embarrassing.</p><h4>Cleaned up some code!</h4><p>Did some early Spring cleaning here and there...</p><h4>Month Number has been replaced with Month Name...</h4><p>Instead of showing months as numbers, month names have replaced the month number to make dates more full.</p><h4>New Keyboard Shortcut!</h4><p>Alt+Enter can now be used to quickly generate inline referencing.</p><h3>V1.0</h3><p>Released</p></div></center></body>
